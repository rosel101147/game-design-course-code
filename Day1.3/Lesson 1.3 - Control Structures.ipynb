    "# Lesson 1.3 - Control Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Last lesson, we worked with variables and operations to manipulate them, and yesterday you put together some massive combos to inflict upon our poor Practice Dummy. However, to test your combos, you had to do what I'll call the Brute Force method, trying things over and over and over again until you get the results that you want. This required an astounding amount of coding to get simple results (though you were likely only executing one line at a time). But there is an easier way. \n",

    "## Introducing Control Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Control Structures allow you to perform complex operations with relative ease. This is the \"thinking\" part of the program. We will employ the operations and variables we learned yesterday, along with the Boolean logic operators you learned about in Activity 1 to manipulate these control structures to give the desired outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of you are already familiar with the concepts of control structures. We will discuss the two main categories today, conditionals and loops. To learn about how to use these control structures in Python, we will be creating the classic game: RoShamBo (also known as Rock, Paper, Scissors). For a quick refresher on how the game is played, here's an excellent video by the greatest Rock, Paper, Scissors player of all time: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=nKm8LXwKnbs\n",
